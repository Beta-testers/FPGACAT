[NOTES]
Pull the 15XX sound chip or the shared memory test will fail - The 15XX sound chip writes to memory from 0x4000 to 0x403F (it writes 00-02,08-0A, 10-12, etc.)  So the RAM config starts testing at 4040.   You can test the full RAM (change the start to 4000) if you pull the 15XX custom chip first.
