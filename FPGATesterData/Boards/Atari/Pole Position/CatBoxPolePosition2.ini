[NOTES]
NOTE: The RAMs from 4800-57FF might test bad even if they are OK.  The Z80 game software never reads these RAMs and it has been determined that certain RAM types can't be read by the Z80.  AMD, Tosiba and Hitachi RAMS have a good chance of passing the RAM tests.  Fujitsu RAMs almost always fail when accessed through the Z80 even if they work through the Z8002.
