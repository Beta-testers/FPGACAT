[NOTES]
The Ms-PacMan daughterboard overlays the ROMs on the main board in a strange way, so that when you do a ROM test with all ROMs enabled, you read the ROMs on the main board only.  So if you have the standard pac-man ROMs on the main board you should verify with the pacman configuration even if the tester is plugged in to a ms-pacman daughterboard.
