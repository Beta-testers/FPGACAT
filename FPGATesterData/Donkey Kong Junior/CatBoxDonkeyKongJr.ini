[NOTES]
Note that the ROMs are strange in DKJR so just one overall checksum is provided for the entire ROM set.

From Braze's DKJR page:
DKjr uses a goofy memory map in terms of what Z80 memory locations are mapped into the three 2764 eproms (5B, 5C and 5E). One would normally think that each chip would contain a contiguous memory address space, but for DKjr each of the 8K byte eproms are divided up into four 2K blocks.

5B: 0x0000 - 0x07ff   5C: 0x2000 - 0x27ff   5E: 0x4000 - 0x47ff
    0x0800 - 0x0fff       0x4800 - 0x4fff       0x2800 - 0x2fff
    0x3000 - 0x37ff       0x1000 - 0x17ff       0x5000 - 0x57ff
    0x3800 - 0x3fff       0x5800 - 0x5fff       0x1800 - 0x1fff
