[NOTES]
The POKEY is clocked in a strange way on missile command (maybe to keep it clocking when the CPU clock is paused?)  So the PRNG (random number) generator test on the pokey screen will fail since we are not able to read in a random number for each clock.

If you initialize the pokey and the random number output fluctuates, then the random number generator is very likely OK.
