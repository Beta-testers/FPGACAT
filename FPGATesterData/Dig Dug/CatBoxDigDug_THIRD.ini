[NOTES]
The chip locations are for the early boards that don't have the CPUs along one edge.  The main CPU is 6J/K on this board, 1B/C on the later board. 

Use a sig data delay of 100 if you want to see the RAM chip select low when doing SA on RAMs


If you are testing DigDug through the second or third CPUs, please remove the main CPU or it will be trying to boot the game and will cause memory errors.
